The polarized structure and long neurites of neurons pose a unique challenge for proper mitochondrial 
distribution. It is widely accepted that mitochondria move from the cell body to axon ends and vice 
versa; however, we have found that mitochondria originating from the axon ends moving in the retrograde
 direction never reach to the cell body, and only a limited number of mitochondria moving in the 
 anterograde direction from the cell body arrive at the axon ends of mouse hippocampal neurons. 
 Furthermore, we have derived a mathematical formula using the Fokker-Planck equation to characterize 
 features of mitochondrial transport, and the equation could determine altered mitochondrial transport 
 in axons overexpressing parkin. Our analysis will provide new insights into the dynamics of
  mitochondrial transport in axons of normal and unhealthy neurons.
